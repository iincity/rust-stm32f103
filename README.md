# Rust stm32f103
This is supposed to be a rust library for the STM32F103 microcontroller.

## Examples
See: https://github.com/rudihorn/rust-stm32f103-examples

## Contributions
I'm happy for any suggestions on how to improve this library, as I am fairly new to the Rust programming language. The variant here compiles quite efficiently, but is not necessarily the nicest way to program things, either way let me know!
